                <h2>Jennylyn Anne Ramos</h2>
                <p>I'd like to introduce to you all a woman who fights every battle with all her heart and courage. 
                Women have negative thoughts in her mind but never think of giving up. She is a happy-go-lucky lady
                with a good personality that everyone often said to her. She always prioritized her family over everything 
                else. My name is Jennylyn Anne O. Ramos, 20 years of age, and was born on June 18, 2001. I am currently 
                residing in Dr. Pilapil St. San Miguel, Pasig City, and am living with my grandmother which I also considered 
                as my second mother. I am studying in 1st-year college taking 
                BSIT in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig (PLP).</p>

                <div class="fam-info">
                    <p>My family is big and happy, but we 
                    are not always happy because we face 
                    various challenges in life that we 
                    sometimes believe we would be unable 
                    to overcome. However, because of God, 
                    our minds are full of hope that we will 
                    be able to overcome all obstacles in our 
                    lives. We are 4 members in our family where 
                    I am the youngest, sadly our parents left us 
                    at a young age and they are now in God's hands. 
                    I am currently living with my grandmother since I 
                    was a baby. I don't live under the same roof as 
                    my siblings, but it isn't a cause for us not to 
                    be close; in fact, I am close to my sibling. 
                    Because some of my cousins have their own families, 
                    they live in different cities and provinces. Even 
                    if we may not see each other regularly, we ensure 
                    that we remain in contact and are aware of what is 
                    going on in their lives.
                    Family is family.‚Äù - Linda Linney</p>

                        <h3>Strength and Weaknesses</h3> <br>
                        <p> When I first begin this path, I am quite nervous 
                            and lack confidence in myself since I believe I 
                            will completely screw up everything. But, as an IT 
                            student, my greatest strength is that I am a very 
                            patient person, which IT also need in their daily 
                            routine: for example, when I am doing a project that 
                            is related to coding and meets several problems, I am 
                            very patient to figure out where I am going wrong and 
                            why it isn't working at all. My greatest weakness is
                            that I get scared while speaking in front of a large group 
                            of people; my forehead sweats as a result of my nervousness 
                            and shyness, but I wish to overcome this flaw.</p> <br>

                        <h3>Skills/Talent</h3> <br>
                        <p> To be honest, I'm not sure what my skill is, 
                            and I believe I'm still searching for it. 
                            But, as a human being, I do possess abilities 
                            that I am pleased to boast about. Why do I say 
                            that? Because I am a very understanding person. 
                            Because I never put my anger first until I understand 
                            the true explanation for what is happening. The other 
                            is that I'm a good listener, as evidenced by my 
                            ability to recall directions to a location when asked.</p> <br>

                        <p>Teenagers like me have different hobbies. I love 
                            taking pictures of my friends, also the beautiful 
                            scenery and environment. I also love watching 
                            movies with the genre of Rom-Com and Horror. Lastly, 
                            I love eating when I am bored.</p> <br>
